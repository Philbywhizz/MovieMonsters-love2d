# Project Scope

To keep things into perspective, this scope document will define each version of MovieMonster.

## Version 0.1.0 - An empty shell testing ECS

I want to use an ECS framework rather than OOP, so to keep things simple this version will have the following conditions before being released:

### Limitations

- A single defined monster (player), with basic movement (fwd, back, turn left, turn right).
- No actors.
- No props.
- No vehicles.
- No aircraft.
- No default game theme, end condition or score keeping.
- An empty city map for testing movement and bounds only.
- Simple shapes for graphics.

### Gameplay scenario conditions and setup

- A single stage that fills up the whole screen.
- A single monster positioned at the center of the world controlled by the player.

## Version 0.0.0 - framework testing and setup

This version will simply setup and test any initial game libraries, testing utilities, github actions, etc. There is no gameplay for this version outside of an empty shell.
